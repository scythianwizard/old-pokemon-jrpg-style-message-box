<div id="dialogbox">The Tortoise and the Hare|
Once upon a time, in a vast and bustling forest, lived a speedy hare who boasted about how fast he could run.|
Tired of hearing the hare's bragging, a slow but wise tortoise challenged him to a race.|
The hare, bursting with laughter, accepted the challenge, thinking it was an easy win.|
As the race began, the hare zoomed ahead, leaving the tortoise far behind.|
Confident of his lead, the hare decided to rest under a tree, and soon, fell fast asleep.|
Meanwhile, the tortoise continued on, steady and slow, never stopping, until he passed the sleeping hare.|
Ultimately, the tortoise crossed the finish line first.|
Remember: Consistent efforts can lead to success - however slow they may be.|
Having a great potential is of little value if it is not cultivated.|
